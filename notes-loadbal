1) Is the effort to construct a load balanced simulation worth it.
 Prerequisite: a working simulation.
 As a concrete example, we use the ringtest on an apple silicon laptop
   git clone https://github.com/neuronsimulator/ringtest
   cd ringtest
   nrnivmodl mod # For the moment, focus on NEURON simulation.
                 # or else nrnivmodl -coreneuron mod
   nrniv -python ringtest.py -h # take a look at the options
   nrniv -python ringtest.py -tstop 1000
    for this simulation of 16 rings, 8 cells per ring and 16 distinct cell
    types of cells beteen 10 and 20 sections in size the
    runtime was 3.5s with 100% loadbalance (only 1 process).

    Trying again with
   mpiexec -n 6 nrniv -python -mpi ringtest.py -tstop 1000
    the runtime is 1.35s with 61.6% loadbalance.
    Ideally we hoped for a runtime of 3.5/6 = 0.58s
